## 📌 Project Description
This is a real-time **Face Detection** project using OpenCV. The script captures live video from a webcam and detects human faces using Haar Cascade classifiers.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects **human faces** in real-time.
- Uses **OpenCV** for face detection.
- Displays detected faces with bounding boxes.
- Press **'q'** to exit the webcam window.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
